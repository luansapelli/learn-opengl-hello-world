# Learn OpenGL - Hello Triangle

## Introduction

This is a simple project to learn OpenGL. It is based on the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorial.
The project is written in C++ and uses the [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) library for window management and the [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) library to load OpenGL functions.

I used my own boilerplate code to setup the project. It is available [here](https://github.com/luansapelli/opengl-gfx-boilerplate).

This project is a simple triangle rendered on the screen. It is the "hello world" of OpenGL.

## What I learned

- How to setup a project using GLFW and GLAD
- How to create a window and a OpenGL context
